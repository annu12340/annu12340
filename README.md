As a developer with a passion for creating magic with code, I strive to push the limits of what's possible with 0's and 1's. The green dots on my GitHub profile show my developer journey. I worked as an SRE at Twitter. I have also interned at Twitter, GitHub and StorFront. I am honored to have been recognized for my talents and potential, receiving the Linux International Diversity Scholarship and being named a GHC) andGHCI scholar. <br/>
            
I am also proud of my participation and wins in several national and international hackathons, which have been a great opportunity to showcase my creativity, problem-solving skills, and ability to work under pressure to deliver exceptional results. All these achievements are a testament to my dedication to learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the field of programming.
